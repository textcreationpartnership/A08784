            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

Neither take it in ill part that I haue not certi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fyed you ſo much ere now: euen then (perchan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce) when you firſt heard ſome rumor of me con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the Catholicke faith, for I would not ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shly moue ſuch a matter, or with out firme foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation acquaint you with that, which I should not be able to defend. for you may not think me ignorant of what oppoſites I may ſuspect in ſuch a caſe, wherefore I thought it more ſecure for

both parties, to deferre it vntill this tyme. Maruail not therefore, I pray you, either at my matter or manner of wryting, but patiently attend the end, and I doubt not but the ſequele will giue you better content, or at least no iust cauſe of offence. The dutie to our Mother, loue to your ſelfe, and the reſt our poore Brothers and Sisters is cauſe of both, and therfore though I beginne more abruptlie then I would or had intended, it is to avoyd prolixite where the matter it ſelfe is ſo vr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent.</p>

                     </gap>retickes doe not, but defend euery man his phariſie.</p>
                  <p>The Catholicke opinion, that this chapter doth treat of the Sacramentall eating of Chriſtes bodie in the Euchariſt, may be proued by theſe ſower argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentes; firſt out of this verie place of Scripture it ſelf, Secundly by the teſtimonie of the Church, thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dly by the Fathers, Fourthby by the abſurdities which otherwiſe would follow.</p>
                  <p>Concerning the firſt out of the text (to omitt ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny moe) theſe three may ſuffice.</p>
                  <p>Firſt therfore our lord ſpeaketh of a thing to be, or that ſhable, when the ſaith:<note n="m" place="margin">¶. 51.</note> the bread which I will giue, is my fleſh for the life of the world. But if the bread in this place should ſignifie Chriſt, as he is receaued by ſaith, he should not ſpeake of a thing, to be, for that kind of eating by faith, hath bine a thinge common in all ages, and the Fathers of the old teſtament did eat. Chriſt in that manner.</p>
                  <p>The ſecund argument may be made by comparing theſe wordes with the wordes of the ſupper: for ſo great is the ſimilitude, that the holy Scripture ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth manifeſtly to craue that to be reſtored, which hath bine heere promiſed: for heere it is ſaid: The bread which I will giue is my flesh for the life of the world. But there:<note n="n" place="margin">Matth. 26.26.</note> Take yee and eat, for this is my body,<note n="o" place="margin">Luc 22.19.</note> which is giuen for you vnto remiſſion of ſins.</p>
                  <p>The third argument may be taken out of the wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:14133:126"/>
following: to witt: Therfore the Iewes did ſtriue amonge themſelues ſaying: how can this man giue vs his flesh to eat? And out of thoſe of his diſciples a little after ſaying: This is a hard ſpeach and who can heare him? For out of theſe wee may collect, that as well the Iewes as his diſciples themſelues, did vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand ſome new and wonderfull thinge propounded by Chriſt. Yet our lord did not therfore correct them, but did agayne inculcate and vrge the ſame ſaying: Vnleſſe you shall eat the fleſh of ther ſo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ne of man, and drincke his blood you shall not haue life in you.</p>
                  <p>Secondly it is proued out of the teſtimonie of the Church: for the<note n="p" place="margin">in epiſtola ad Neſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rium.</note> Councell of Alexandrie, approued in the third generall Synod expoundeth that: <hi>Vnleſse you shall eate, &amp;c.</hi> to be ſpoken of the receauing of this Sacrament. the ſame doth the<note n="q" place="margin">Sub finem tertij tomi. Seſſ. 13. cap. 2.</note> ſeventh Synod and lykewyſe the Councell of Trent expoundeth the wordes: He which eateth me shall liue for me, to be alſo of this Sacrament now although theſe Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cells made no decree of this matter: yet it is ſufficient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly euident, what all the Biſhops of theſe three gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall Councells did thinke, and conſequently the whole Church, which they did repreſent.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly it is proued out of the Fathers, that haue written commentaries vpon S. Iohn, and with one generall conſent expound theſe places of the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Euchariſt. as <hi>S. Chryſoſtome, Auguſtin, Cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rill, Theophylactus, Euthymius, Rupertus. S. Thomas, Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cholas, Hyramus,</hi> and <hi>Dionyſius,</hi> the <hi>Carthuſian,</hi> beſides infinit others who for their purpoſe and as occaſion did offerre it ſelfe in expounding this ghoſpell, as <hi>Origen, Athanaſius, Baſil,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly this veritie is proued out of the abſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dities which would follow. Firſt therfore it would follow that <hi>S. Iohn</hi> should haue written nothing of this Sacramt, for he toucheth this matter no where, vnleſſe in this place.

wherfore<note n="r" place="margin">lib 3 de conſenſu Euang cap 1.</note> 
                     <hi>S. Auguſtine</hi> affirmeth that <hi>S. Iohn</hi> [hath written nothing of the ſupper of our lord in his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per place, as the reſt did, becauſe he had written at large of it before. Secondly it would follow that Chriſt did neuer explicate the fruit, and excellencie of this Sacrament, which he hath done very often of Baptiſme for in the laſt ſupper he only inſtituted it<note n="ſ" place="margin">S.

Becauſe the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles without doubt would haue beene moued and troubled when they heard: Take yee and eat for this is my body, if they had not beene inſtructed before. Thirdly it would follow that there ſhould be no diuine precept for the receauing of this Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. For the other Euangeliſtes mention only the inſtitution, and that as often as it is taken it be done in remembrance of our Sauiours paſſion.</p>

Iohn: Hee which eateth this bread ſhall liue foreuer. Wee vnfainedly collect, that the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment taken vnder one kind doth ſo ſuffice; that two formes or ſpecies are not neceſſarily required to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaue the fruit of this Sacrament or communion. but there is great diſſimilitude betweene the water wher<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>of our Sauiour ſpeaketh in the fourth of <hi>S.

For all interpreters expound the latter place to be vnderſtood of the Euchariſt, as is already shexed; but no man at any tyme hath euer taken the latter in that ſenſe. Moreouer S.

But the bread in the ſixth chapter our Sauiour himſelf ſaid, it was his flesh, when he ſaith: The bread which I will giue is my flesh.</p>
                  <p>The ſecond argument alſo is Luthers: in this manner: In the ſixth of S. Iohn our Sauiour diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted of that eating of heauenly bread, which giueth

                  <p>I anſwere; the aſſumptum is falſe: for Sacramen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall eating alſo doth giue life: as in Baptiſme not only the internall waſhing but alſo the externall, doth cleance ſoules the firſt formally, the other ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fecting as by the inſtrument, and as it is written:<note n="z" place="margin">Act. 15.</note> pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rifying theire hartes by faith: ſoe it is alſo ſaid,<note n="a" place="margin">Epheſ. 3.</note> cleanſing it by the lauer of water in the word of ife. Neither doth it hinder, that the Sacramentall eating doth not giue life without faith: For that proceedeth from the vnprepared diſpoſition of the receauer, and not from the Sacrament it ſelf. which of it ſelf is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes powerfull and ſufficient.</p>

But this ſtraight precept can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be vnderſtood of a Sacramentall eating: for ſo all infants ſhould periſh, which can eat nothing but only ſucke milke: yea all that cannot communicate being hindered by ſome lawfull and neceſſarie cauſe should likwyſe perish, although otherwiſe baptized and iuſtified.</p>
                  <p>I anſwear it is a common difficultie how ſoeuer this place be vnderſtood. for if the Aduerſaries will haue it vnderſtood of a ſpirituall eating by faith; how, I pray you, shall infants eat it who neither ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ue any vſe of the ſpirit or actuall faith? yea it weare more eaſie to inſtill ſome little parte of the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment into infantes, then to make them to belieue, therfore I ſay this place doth perteyne only to the aged. Finally either theſe wordes: Vnleſſe yee shall eat &amp;c. Do ſignifie a precept, or a mean neceſſarie vnto ſalu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>The fourth argument is likwiſe Luthers: where he alleadgeth that<note n="c" place="margin">lib 2 con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tra Iulian.</note> 
                     <hi>S.

                     <hi>Peter Martyr</hi> and others, for <hi>S. Auguſtine</hi> expoundeth the ſixth of S. <hi>Iohn</hi> ſo ſpiritually that he ſaith: belieue and thou haſt eaten. And in an other place: To belieue in him,<note n="e" place="margin">Ibidem tract. 26.</note> is to eat the liuely bread. and in an other place he ſaith that theſe wordes: Vnleſſe yee shall eat the fleſh of the ſon of man, do ſignifie no other thing, but that wee ought to communicate, and cogitate earneſly in our mynd the paſſion of our lord, and his fleſh crucifyed for vs. Alſo<note n="f" place="margin">lib. 1.

                  <p>I anſwear: to the place of S. <hi>Auguſtine</hi> brought by Luther which is the firſt booke againſt Iulian, and not in the ſecund as he citeth firſt wee muſt obſerue that S. <hi>Auſtine</hi> doth often tymes ſay,<note n="k" place="margin">lib. 3. de peccator me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritis and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſ. c. 4 and in Serm. ad infantes que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritat Beda in comment. 1.

                  <p>Secondly wee muſt note, that infants are not only not bound to the communion indeed, but neither by externall deſire, wherof they are by no means ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable,
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:14133:129"/>
but only by an inward deſire which they ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ue, when they are baptized: for then they receaue power to participate of the Buchariſt, and becauſe euery one that is borne doth naturally deſire meat: therfore alſo they in that they are borne agayne in Chriſt, doe craue the meat or food of the regenerate yet ſo, as to be receaued in it tyme and place: therfo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re infants do neither communicate ſpiritually not Sacramentally concerning the thing, but Sacramen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tally by an inward deſire, whervpon it followeth that it is not altogether the ſame for them to be ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptized and to communicate, although they are done together, becauſe the one proceedeth from the other.

                  <p>I anſwear therfore to the argument, that S. <hi>Auſtine</hi> doth expound this place to be vnderſtood of a Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cramentall eating, but yet that he doth attribut that eating to infants, not in the thing, but in an inward deſire, which is had by baptiſme as wee haue ſaid.</p>
                  <p>To the other two places of <hi>S.

eating, but that he might ſignifie the end of the Sacrament to be this to nourish our ſoule and not our body for he is truly refreshed with this meat that eateth in hart, not that preſſeth it with his teeth, to witt: only with his teeth: for he doth not exclude corporall eating, when in the ſame place he ſaith that Iudas did eat it only corporally: but only he doth pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferre the ſpirituall eating before the corporall, becau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſe the ſpirituall doth profitt without the carnall, but not the corporall with out the ſpirituall: The like is that place of Oſea: <hi>I vvill mercy not Sacrifice:</hi>

Secondly becauſe he himſelf doth explicate what is the litterall ſenſe, which ſeemeth to ſound any wickednes, to witt, that wherein the Capharnaites did take the wordes of Chriſt,<note place="margin">tract. 27. in Ioann. &amp; Pſal 98.</note> who thought that his flesh was to be torne, as wee ſee it done in the shambles and ſome little parte giuen to euery one therfore when S. <hi>Auſtine</hi> ſaith that by this precept.
